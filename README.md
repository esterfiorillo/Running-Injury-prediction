# Running Injury prediction

### Installations
To use this repository you only need to run the code using Python 3 versions and the necessary libraries are all in Anaconda.

### Project Motivation
This is the last project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program and it aims to understand better about what can be the risks involving running. For that, a few analysis were made and also a few machine learning models were training to predict whether an athlete would get injured or not.

### File Descriptions 
The dataset was download from the kaggle page : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners and it is available in this repository. 
Also, there is a notebook with all the analysis made for answering the questions proposed.

### Results
Results were reported in the following medium post: https://medium.com/@ester.fiorillo01/injury-prediction-for-runners-c5afb3c34686
